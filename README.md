# WRITTEN ANALYSIS: PEWLETT-HACKARD

## OVERVIEW
Pewlett Hackard has noticed that a big part of its workforce population is nearing their retirement age. The company is therefore trying to future-proof its labor force by determining how many people will retire. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Queries were run to get results in 4 .csv files listing specific-required employee information. 

## RESULTS
Some notable results gotten from analysis of Pewlett Hackard employee data is listed as follows:

•	A combined percentage of more than 60% of the retiring employees are in ‘senior’ positions. A closer look at the distribution shows that these positions are the ‘Senior Engineer (25916)’ and ‘Senior Staff (24926)’ positions.

•	Since >60% of the retiring employees are ’Senior’ in some capacity, there is mentorship eligibility opportunity present. This program is needed in order for Pewlett Hackard to continue operating at the same or similar level. The approximate number of employees to be trained is 1,549 - as gotten in the result for the query written for the ‘mentorship eligibility’ table.

•	Some employees have held multiple positions at Pewlett Hackard. This is evident in the query written to retrieve the unique titles as some employees have duplicate entries, owing to the fact that they’ve held more than 1 title in their time at Pewlett Hackard. It also shows growth/promotion potential for employees in the company.

•	The number of all retiring employees amounts to about 24% of the workforce at Pewlett Hackard. 24% is significant as the company will see a decline in productivity if it doesn’t strategically prepare for the impacts of the silver tsunami.
  
  ## SUMMARY
•	After analyzing the retiring titles chart, it is clear that 72,458 roles will become vacant as the impacts of the silver tsunami become evident. This is a large number of vacancies to fill, and Pewlett Hackard has to be strategic in addressing the impacts of the retirement tsunami. It may be a good time to conduct a review of roles, determine if there are any redundant roles that won’t need to be filled - so it can phase them out. In addition, projects should be reviewed as well to identify projects with the least impact on business needs.
  
•	To address the question of whether or not there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees for the mentorship program, there are about 1549 in number. This translates to a 46:1 trainee-mentor ratio - which shows that the silver tsunami outweighs the number of eligible mentors.
  
  ### TWO ADDITIONAL QUERIES FOR INSIGHT
•	Running a query to determine the number of retiring employees by department. This will show what departments will lose the highest amount of employees, and help target mentorship efforts in an efficient manner.
  
  •	Another query would be one that shows the number of employees who should be eligible for promotion, possibly based on the number of years they’ve spent in a role. Knowing that number or breakdown could help Pewlett Hackard more strategically prepare to fill its soon to be vacant positions.
